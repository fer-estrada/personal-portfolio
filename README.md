# personal-portfolio

My personal portfolio website, featuring a home page with a quick intro about myself, a picture (of SpongeBob since I dont't have pictures of myself in my computer), a list of my skills, and a quote I greatly resonate with.

# **ABOUT**

The "About" page features two different sections: one for philosophy and one for fashion. These are the two most prominent subjects I am knowledgeable in aside from coding. Although they are more recent discoveries of mine compared to tech, they both have still taken up so much of time (and money buying books!).

# **PORTFOLIO**

The "Portfolio" page features three different sections each mentioning a project I hope to be able to create in the future. As of right now, I have no projects to show off. However, I do have plans and ideas of what I want to work on as soon as I feel ready to start on them. The list goes a lot longer but these three are the ones I am most excited about.
